This is a simple game I made as an assignment for school.

You can try to buy and combine items to make a profit. For example you can buy two H and an O to create water, and then sell it for more than what you paid for the atoms.

Run main.java to start the game. 
Inside this repo there is also a class diagram, which is part of the assignment.
